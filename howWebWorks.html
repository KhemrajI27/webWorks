<!-- Question 1: What is HTTP?-->
 
<!-- HTTP is an acronym that stands for Hyper Text Transfer. This is how the browser and web communicate. -->


<!-- Question 2: What is a URL? -->


<!-- URL stands for Universal Resource Locator. It's best described as an address for a specific resource found on the web. -->


<!-- Question 3: What is DNS? -->


<!-- DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a system that converts URLs into an IP address. -->


<!-- Question 4: What is a query string? -->


<!-- Query strings are values that are passed into the URL that provides extra information in that specific form. -->


<!-- Question 5: List two HTTP Verbs and their use cases. -->


<!-- - GET - a way to get data from servers.
     - POST - a way to send data to a server. -->


<!-- Question 6: What is a HTTP request? -->


<!-- A HTTP request is a request from a client to a server that follows the HTTP protocol. -->


<!-- Question 7: What is an HTTP response? -->


<!-- An HTTP response is a response from a server to the client. IT's when you can receive the information from the server in the form of HTML, CSS, JS or more. -->


<!-- Question 8: What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers. -->


<!-- HTTP headers give additional information about the request or the response from client to the server or vise versa.
    - Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Cookie, etc.
    - Response Headers: Content Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, etc. -->


<!-- Question 9: What happens when you type a URL in a browser? -->


<!-- First the browser will change the URL into an IP address using DNS. Then the browser will make a request using that IP address. The server then sends a response to the browser. The browser then makes a DOM from the response and finds any other resources needed from that IP address. Lastly the browser makes a separate HTTP request for the resources and receives response from the server for each requests. -->
